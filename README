Compiling and Executing the Code

Follow NS-3's instructions to compile and execute the scripts. These
instructions are given in their tutorial. Our executables are named
Q1, Q1-Extra, Q2 and Q3.


For Question 1, the pcap traces will be stored as Question1*.pcap, which can
be opened in Wireshark for better viewing. The Q1-Extra executable contains
an added server and client instance to the nodes respectively. We also provide
command line arguments like "--latency=1" to set the latency to 1ms.

For Question 2, we show the packet loss percentage vs. time in a file called
Question2-loss.txt, along with the pcap traces.

For Question 3, we only show the pcap traces.
